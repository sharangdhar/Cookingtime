Cool idea. I think that you can find enough work for 2 people to fully demonstrate course concepts and also branch out into some more interesting features, like the OpenCV barcode scanning. Perhaps there are other interesting APIs you could make use of too, or data sets regarding food features (i.e., average mass, specific heat, etc., as you discussed).

### Andrew

I'm a little concerned about how you'd handle foods which you haven't seen before, since " foodâ€™s mass, specific heat and enthalpy of fusion" are not exactly things that are easy to find. Additionally, you might want to set priorities on the aspects of your project, as you could very easily get bogged down on getting the automatic cooking time part.

### Shuai

Your project is really cool and the size is ok. To make it even better, I would suggest you to go further by thinking of other APIs you can integrate to extend your features. For example, since users are posting about prepackaged foods, you might want to consider using shopping APIs such as Amazon, Google Shopping, and/or Ebay to support access to the food as merchandise.

<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>

<ul>
<li>Product Owner: Elliot Lockerman</li>
<li><p>Short description of overall project</p>

<ul>
<li>Motivation - Elliot
<ul>
<li>The project was inspired by my frustration with cooking food in a microwave. Its seems that food always comes out frozen or burned, and the product&#8217;s packaging is almost useless because it does not take in to account your personal microwave. If you know a few key physical properties, the math describing the heading of a substance is rather simple. However, this data is hard to come by for food and microwaves. </li>
<li>Gathering data is where the web excels. Cookingti.me leverages crowd sourced data gathering to provide personalized cooking times that continually improve along with being a one-stop shop food social network, where you can post recipes, and reviews, and find out what you can cook with what you have available.</li>

<ul>
<li>We accomplished the vast majority of our goals to spec.</li>
<li>However, 
<ul>
<li>Posting photos is only partially completed</li>
<li>We plan to continue to improve our apps implementation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How current prototype fits into overal goals
<ul>
<li>For the first sprint, we focused on core functionally, both generic webapp features, like user authentication and UX design, and our primary special features, thermodynamic modeling.</li>
<li>While our first sprint focused on core features, our second sprint will emphasize more on interconnectivity and interfacing with the outside world, both physical and virtual.</li>

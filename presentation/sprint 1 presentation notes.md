# Sprint 1 Presentation Notes


## Preamble

- Product Owner: Elliot Lockerman
- Short description of overall project
    - Motivation - Elliot
        - The project was inspired by my frustration with cooking food in a microwave. Its seems that food always comes out frozen or burned, and the product's packaging is almost useless because it does not take in to account your personal microwave. If you know a few key physical properties, the math describing the heading of a substance is rather simple. However, this data is hard to come by for food and microwaves. 
        - Gathering data is where the web excels. Cookingti.me leverages crowd sourced data gathering to provide personalized cooking times that continually improve along with being a one-stop shop food social network, where you can post recipes, and reviews, and find out what you can cook with what you have available.

- Self evaluation - Sharang
    - We accomplished the vast majority of our goals to spec.
    - However, 
        - Posting photos is only partially completed
        - We plan to continue to improve our apps implementation
- How current prototype fits into overal goals
    - For the first sprint, we focused on core functionally, both generic webapp features, like user authentication and UX design, and our primary special features, thermodynamic modeling.
    - While our first sprint focused on core features, our second sprint will emphasize more on interconnectivity and interfacing with the outside world, both physical and virtual.
